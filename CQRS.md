## CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation

**CQRS** is a software architectural pattern that separates the responsibilities of reading (queries) and writing (commands) in a system. Instead of using a single model for both operations, CQRS proposes using separate models, each optimized for its respective responsibility.

**Why use CQRS?**

* **Scalability:** By separating reads and writes, you can optimize each model individually. For example, the read model can be highly denormalized for fast queries, while the write model can be more normalized to ensure data integrity.
* **Flexibility:** CQRS allows you to use different technologies for each model, choosing the best tools for each case.
* **Complexity:** In complex systems, separating responsibilities can simplify development and maintenance.

**How does CQRS work?**

* **Commands:** Represent actions that modify the system's state. When a command is executed, it generates an event that records the change.
* **Queries:** Are used to read data from the system. Queries do not modify the state, only return information.
* **Event Sourcing:** CQRS is often combined with Event Sourcing, where the current state of the system is derived from a sequence of events. This allows you to reconstruct the system's state at any time, which is useful for auditing and data recovery.

**Example in Java:**

Imagine an e-commerce system. In CQRS, you would have:

* **Command Model:**
  * **Commands:** `CreateOrder`, `AddItem`, `CancelOrder`, etc.
  * **Events:** `OrderCreated`, `ItemAdded`, `OrderCanceled`, etc.
  * **Aggregates:** `Order`, `Product`, etc.

* **Query Model:**
  * **Views:** `OrderSummary`, `ProductList`, etc.
  * **Projections:** Functions that transform events into views.

```java
// Command Model (simplified)
public class Order {
    private List<Event> events = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addItem(Item item) {
        events.add(new ItemAdded(item));
    }
}

// Query Model (simplified)
public class OrderSummaryView {
    private Long id;
    private List<Item> items;
    // ... other attributes

    // Constructor that creates the view from a sequence of events
}
```

**When to use CQRS?**

* **Systems with high read load:** CQRS allows you to optimize queries.
* **Systems with complex write requirements:** CQRS can help manage the complexity of write operations.
* **Systems that require high availability:** CQRS can be used to implement more resilient systems to failures.

**Conclusion**

CQRS is a powerful pattern that can be applied in various scenarios. By separating read and write responsibilities, you get a more scalable, flexible, and easy-to-maintain system. However, it's important to evaluate the trade-offs before adopting CQRS, as it can increase system complexity.
