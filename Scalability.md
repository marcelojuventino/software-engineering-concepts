## Scalability

**Scalability** refers to a system's ability to handle increasing workloads efficiently. As a system grows in size or usage, it should be able to adapt without compromising performance or reliability.

### Types of Scalability

* **Horizontal Scalability:** Adding more hardware resources (e.g., servers) to handle the increased load.
* **Vertical Scalability:** Upgrading the hardware resources of existing servers (e.g., more RAM, CPU).

### Architectural Patterns for Scalability

1. **Microservices Architecture:**
   * **Decoupling:** Each microservice can be scaled independently based on its workload.
   * **Horizontal Scalability:** Easy to add or remove instances of individual microservices.

2. **Event-Driven Architecture:**
   * **Asynchronous Processing:** Decouples components, allowing for better scalability.
   * **Horizontal Scalability:** Can easily scale out event processors.

3. **Serverless Architecture:**
   * **Automatic Scaling:** Providers manage the underlying infrastructure, scaling resources based on demand.
   * **Pay-per-use:** Only pay for the resources used, reducing costs.

4. **Caching:**
   * Stores frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the load on the database.
   * Can be implemented at various levels (e.g., application, database, CDN).

5. **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**
   * Distributes content across multiple servers closer to users.
   * Reduces latency and improves performance.

6. **Database Sharding:**
   * Partitioning a large database into smaller, more manageable databases.
   * Can improve scalability and performance.

7. **Load Balancing:**
   * Distributes traffic across multiple servers, preventing a single point of failure and improving scalability.

### Example: A Scalable E-commerce System

* **Microservices:** Separate services for product catalog, order processing, and payment.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Use events to trigger actions (e.g., order processing, inventory updates).
* **Caching:** Cache popular product information and frequently accessed data.
* **CDN:** Distribute static content (images, CSS, JS) across a network of servers.
* **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple instances of each microservice.
